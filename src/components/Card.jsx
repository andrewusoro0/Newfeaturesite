           Taking designs and turning them into pixel-perfect HTML5/CSS3/SCSS frontend representations of Figma mockups.
            I have an eye for design, and the ability to strive for perfection with chosen designs on the various platforms your audience is using.
            I also enjoy walking a client through a new site design process without having to choose mockups.
