           <p className="coordinator">Team LeadershipI tend to gravitate towards leadership roles in IT. I bring to the table strong experience leading distributed and local teams towards the victory line, spanning across multiple product types and industries.
            I lean on my years of personal programming experience, as well as group and pair programming history, to help look ahead for potential road blocks or hurdles along the way. I am comfortable in communications with stakeholders
            or client discussions, and help to foster a team culture to develop and release strong products. I utilize team communication mediums like Slack or Microsoft Teams, and ticketing and issue tracking solutions such as Jira, BaseCamp,
            or GitHub/GitLab. I excel at talent retention, 
           in addition to the hiring of new talent into an existing team.
