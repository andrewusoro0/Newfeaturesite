           GitHub is a repository hosting service, Git is a command-line tool for developers.
            Started learning about Github and its commands eg Push Request, Pull Request, and concluded that Github is the best hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
            It improved my team collaboration skill set. To me, Github is a community for development and developers.
