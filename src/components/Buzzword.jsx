           I started with website development as a frontend developer, with a passion for design and the goal to master frontend development as well as back-end.
            My skill set grew from the basic knowledge of HTML5 to CSS3 using these languages to create a sample website. I was interested in learning more that pushed me into
            Javascript and React.js and advanced quickly into Node.js and Express.js working in groups with senior developers made me understand the full functionality of SCSS, Github, and API development.
            which helped me to create a super fun and user-friendly website.
